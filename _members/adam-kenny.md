I recently earned my DPhil in Anthropology at the University of
Oxford. I am an evolutionary anthropologist, with a background in both
biology and anthropology; I hold a BA in Natural Sciences from the
University of Cambridge (2012) and an MSc in Human Evolution and
Behaviour from University College London (2013).

Broadly, I am interested in the role of inter-group dynamics on human
prosociality. Specifically, my research focuses on the effects of
group identity and inter-group competition on cooperation. My doctoral
thesis involved extensive fieldwork in the city of Siena, Italy, among
local 'neighbourhoods' known as the contrade. I mostly analyse
quantitative data generated through field experiments employing
behavioural economic games. I also have an interest in open research
practices.
