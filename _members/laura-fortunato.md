I am an evolutionary anthropologist with training in both biology and
anthropology, and with a strong commitment to interdisciplinary
scholarship. My formal training includes a 5-year Laurea in biological
sciences from the University of Padova (2003) and graduate degrees
(MRes and PhD) in anthropology from University College London (2004
and 2009).

Between 2010 and 2013, I held an Omidyar Fellowship at the Santa Fe
Institute, an independent research centre that brings together
scientists from across the natural, social, and historical sciences. I
joined the [University of
Oxford](https://www.icea.ox.ac.uk/people/dr-laura-fortunato) in 2013,
as Associate Professor in Evolutionary Anthropology and Tutorial
fellow at [Magdalen
College](https://www.magd.ox.ac.uk/member-of-staff/laura-fortunato/). I
am currently a Research Fellow at the [Santa Fe
Institute](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~fortunato/).

I am a founding member of the Steering Group of the [UK
Reproducibility Network](http://www.ukrn.org/), and a member of the
Board of Directors of the [Software Freedom
Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/).
