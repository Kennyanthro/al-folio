## project aims and activities

What factors sustain cooperation in humans? The answer to this
question is of both theoretical and practical interest, as human
societies face challenges that can only be addressed through
cooperative behaviour. Recent events, most notably in the political
world, highlight the importance of understanding social behaviour
within and between groups.

This project investigates empirically the effect of network structure
and dynamics on social behaviour in humans, focusing on factors
related to cooperation and competition, including the role of social
norms. It brings together researchers with expertise in cultural
evolution, the evolution of cooperation, and the social-psychological
study of inter-group conflict.

The project, in part, involves data collection in the town of Siena,
Italy, which is divided into 17 _contrade_, local neighbourhoods in
historic conflict. Each Sienese is bound to a _contrada_, involving
participation in rituals and other activities throughout the year and
culminating in the _Palio_, two bareback horse races held in the
central town square over the summer months. Thus, this setting can be
used to test hypotheses about patterns of interactions within and
between naturally-occurring human groups. The project also involves
data collection in laboratory settings and across social media
outlets, to provide a broader picture of the effect of network
structure and community norms on social behaviour across human
domains.
