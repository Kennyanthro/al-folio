  abstract = {There is ongoing debate regarding the robustness and
                  credibility of published scientific research. We
                  argue that these issues stem from two broad causal
                  mechanisms: the cognitive biases of researchers and
                  the incentive structures within which researchers
                  operate. The UK Reproducibility Network (UKRN) is
                  working with researchers, institutions, funders,
                  publishers, and other stakeholders to address these
                  issues.},

  title = {In-group bias in human cooperation: insights from

  abstract = {Cooperation in humans shows an in-group bias, with
                  individuals more likely to benefit members of their
                  own in-group than members of other out-groups. This
                  thesis explores the effects of inter-group
                  competition, group relationship, and shared identity
                  on in-group bias, by conducting field experiments
                  among communities in a historic Italian city, namely
                  the \emph{contrade} of Siena. In Chapter 1, I review
                  the literature on the evolution of cooperation and
                  in-group bias. I then describe how field experiments
                  that employ economic games can help elucidate
                  in-group bias in the real world, before outlining
                  how I conducted field experiments with the
                  \emph{contrade}. I describe the \emph{contrade} in
                  greater detail in Chapter 2, using research from my
                  fieldwork among these communities to demonstrate the
                  importance of group relationship in the Sienese
                  context.  In experiment 1 (Chapter 3), I compare
                  in-group and out-group cooperation during a period
                  characterised by low competition vs. high
                  competition. There is no evidence for an effect of
                  competition. However, there is a significant effect
                  of group relationship, with more cooperation among
                  neutral out-groups compared to rival out-groups. In
                  experiment 2 (Chapter 4), I analyse third-party
                  punishment decisions and participants'
                  interpretations of the experiment, to assess whether
                  cooperation within and between \emph{contrade} is
                  supported by social norms. There is limited support
                  for third-party punishment sustaining norms
                  governing either in-group or out-group behaviour. In
                  experiment 3 (Chapter 5), I explore the effect of
                  shared identity on in-group bias, by seeing if a
                  ``common enemy'' encourages out-group
                  cooperation. The common enemy neither increases the
                  perceptions of shared identity nor decreases
                  in-group bias.  I conclude with a meta-analysis in
                  Chapter 6, which reveals an overall strong in-group
                  bias among the \emph{contrade}. The bias is
                  influenced by the relationship between the groups,
                  but is unaffected by the level of competition and
                  attempts to induce a shared identity. This thesis
                  shows that group identities in the real world have a
                  significant impact on social behaviour.}

  title = {Lineal kinship organization in cross-specific perspective},
  journal = {Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B:
                  Biological Sciences},
  volume = {374},
  number = {1780},

  abstract = {I draw on insights from anthropology to outline a
                  framework for the study of kinship systems that
                  applies across animal species with biparental sexual
                  reproduction. In particular, I define lineal kinship
                  organization as a social system that emphasizes
                  interactions among lineally related kin --- that is,
                  individuals related through females only, if the
                  emphasis is towards matrilineal kin, and individuals
                  related through males only, if the emphasis is
                  towards patrilineal kin. In a given population, the
                  emphasis may be expressed in one or more social
                  domains, corresponding to pathways for the
                  transmission of different resources across
                  generations (e.g.\ the allocation of food, the
                  transfer of access to the natal territory or
                  household). A lineal bias in any domain can be
                  viewed as a bias in investment towards a particular
                  set of kin --- specifically, towards the offspring
                  of daughters if the bias is matrilineal, and towards
                  the offspring of sons if the bias is
                  patrilineal. Effectively, investment is restricted
                  to the offspring of the females in the population in
                  one case, and to the offspring of the males in the
                  other. This is distinct from a bias in investment
                  towards daughters and towards sons,
                  respectively. Overall, I propose a shift in
                  focus---from viewing matrilineal and patrilineal
                  kinship as unitary phenomena, to consideration of
                  the different aspects of the social system featuring
                  a bias towards lineally related kin. }
