## philosophy

To the best of our ability, we practise open scholarship. We are open
by default.

---
## code of conduct

The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of lab
members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is generally not
appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations,
or discussions.

---
## best practice

We implement certain practices to help work be efficient and
enjoyable, as well as in line with the principles of open scholarship.

Our primary means of communication is via
[Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/), a platform where lab members can
discuss general points (e.g. related to lab meetings) or hold
conversations about specific projects (e.g. a paper).

We meet most Fridays to share lunch and discuss projects or resources.

In order to work collaboratively — both between lab members and
between past, present, and future you — we use a version control tool
and a repository hosting service. The version control system we use is
[Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/guide), and repositories are
hosted on GitLab™ via [Heptapod](https://heptapod.net/).

Certain practices we adopt can be found in the list below, with links
to relevant guidelines written by others:

- workflows:
  - [plain text/emacs](https://plain-text.co/)
  - [knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/)

- general style conventions:
