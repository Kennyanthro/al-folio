We aim to dia**logue** between **anthro**pology and other
disciplines. We work on the evolution of human behaviour, culture, and
things in between.

Evolutionary anthropology hub at the University of Oxford, led by
[Laura Fortunato](/people/laura-fortunato).

Find out [who we are](/people/), [what we're up to](/projects/), and
[what we've done](/publications/).
